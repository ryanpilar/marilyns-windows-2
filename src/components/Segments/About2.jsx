                                                When designing any space, drapery window treatments are a major component of a roomâ€™s aesthetic. The right curtains or 
                                                sheers help bring a space together into a cohesive design, and can inject color, pattern, texture or simple elegance 
                                                into the room. Specialty coated fabrics offer the increased benefits of temperature control, while motorized options 
                                                allow for easy operation. Regardless of the configuration or accessories, drapery adds an important element for
